/// This function will continuously read data from `reader` and then
/// write it into `writer` in a streaming fashion until `reader`
/// returns EOF.
///
/// On success, the total number of bytes that were copied from
/// `reader` to `writer` is returned.
///
/// If you want to copy the contents of one file to another and youâ€™re
/// working with filesystem paths, see the [`fs::copy`] function.
///
/// [`fs::copy`]: crate::fs::copy
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function will return an error immediately if any call to [`read`] or
/// [`write`] returns an error. All instances of [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] are
/// handled by this function and the underlying operation is retried.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::io;
///
/// fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
///     let mut reader: &[u8] = b"hello";
///     let mut writer: Vec<u8> = vec![];
///
///     io::copy(&mut reader, &mut writer)?;
///
///     assert_eq!(&b"hello"[..], &writer[..]);
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Platform-specific behavior
///
/// On Linux (including Android), this function uses `copy_file_range(2)`,
/// `sendfile(2)` or `splice(2)` syscalls to move data directly between file
/// descriptors if possible.
///
/// Note that platform-specific behavior [may change in the future][changes].
